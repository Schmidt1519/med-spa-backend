# Med Spa capstone (backend)
Backend server used for my devCodeCamp solo capstone project - A web application for the small business owner of a Med Spa. Django REST API backend with a React.js frontend.

## Description
The idea of this project was inspired by a close family member looking to start this type of business in the near future. This is the Django REST API that interacts with a MySQL database and uses the Djoser library for token based user authentication. It allows the business owner to show who they are and what they provide. It is a place for potential customers to learn about the company, see the services they provide, results/testimonials, subscribe to a membership, schedule an appointment, or contact the company.
